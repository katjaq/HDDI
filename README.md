Hypothesis-driven Diffusion Imaging

A script to generate fibers based on the anatomy.

This simulation tries to see how much of a real DWI-based tractography we are able to recover by applying anatomical constraints to randomly drifting particles within the mask.
These constraints could be implemented based on the hypotheses that 
	fibres run perpendicular to gyral crowns,
	follow sulcal fundi,
	have a homogeneous density throughout the white matter
	and are sticky, forming bundles of similar orientation.
Work in progress :)
